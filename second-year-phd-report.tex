\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

During the second year of my PhD, I have been working on several tasks, including research publications, teaching, visiting, participation in conferences, supervision of graduating students, and PhD courses.
%
In this report, I will provide a brief -- yet exhausting -- overview of the activities I have carried out during the second year.

\section{PhD Courses}
\label{sec:phd-courses}

This academic year, I was able to follow the following PhD courses:
\begin{description}
    \item[Multi-platform Programming for Research-Oriented Software] This course was held by Prof.~Giovanni Ciatto for a total of 10 hours (i.e., 2 CFUs \textbf{without} exam).
    %
    \item[An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning] This course was held by Prof.~Mirco Musolesi for a total of 16 hours (i.e., 3 CFUs \textbf{with} exam).
    %
    \item[Risk Assessment of Machine Learning for Cybersecurity] This course was held by Prof.~Fabio Pierazzi for a total of 20 hours (i.e., 4 CFUs \textbf{with} exam).
\end{description}

With this, I have completed reached the required number of CFUs for the PhD program, at least 18 CFUs with exams and maximum 6 CFUs without exams.
%
I have actually reached 20 CFUs with exams and 4 CFUs without exams.
