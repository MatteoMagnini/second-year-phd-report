\section{Research}\label{sec:research}
%
In the last decades \ac{SKE} and \ac{SKI} have been widely studied in the literature.
%
\ac{SKE} techniques aim at extracting symbolic knowledge -- e.g., logic rules -- from sub-symbolic predictors -- mostly \acp{NN} -- to improve their interpretability and trustworthiness.
%
Conversely, \ac{SKI} methods inject symbolic knowledge into sub-symbolic predictors in order to improve their performance or their \ac{QoS}~\cite{DBLP:journals/aamas/AgiolloRMCO23}.

Recently, with the explosive success of \acp{LLM}, both \ac{SKE} and \ac{SKI} evolved to deal with these models.
%
In particular, when \ac{SKE} is applied to \acp{LLM}, the goal is to extract symbolic knowledge from the model concerning a specific task -- e.g., populating an ontology -- or domain -- e.g., extracting classification rules for a specific dataset.
%
Instead, when \ac{SKI} is applied to \acp{LLM}, the goal provides the model with prior (and possibly symbolic) knowledge to improve its performance.
%
In this respect, the two most common approaches are \emph{fine-tuning} and \ac{RAG}.

With these premises, the research activities of my PhD were first focused on the development of new \ac{SKE}/\ac{SKI} methods~\cite{DBLP:journals/logcom/MagniniCO23,DBLP:conf/woa/MagniniCO22,DBLP:conf/cilc/MagniniCO22}, tools~\cite{DBLP:conf/atal/MagniniCO22}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/psykei/psyki-python}}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/psykei/psyke-python}} and applications~\cite{DBLP:journals/cmpb/MagniniCCAO23,DBLP:conf/extraamas/CiattoMBAO23}.
%
Then, the research activities moved towards \ac{LLM} applications and on the incorporation of \ac{SKE}/\ac{SKI} into \acp{LLM}.
%
In the context of healthcare, I have been working both on \ac{SKI}~\cite{DBLP:conf/hc/Magnini24} and on the development of a chatbot for patients with hypertension\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MatteoMagnini/hyperTensionBot}}.
%
This work has already led to a publication~\cite{DBLP:conf/percom/MontagnaAFPKUM24} and a submission~\cite{DBLP:conf/hc/Aguzzi24}.
%
Concerning the extraction of knowledge from \acp{LLM}, I have been working on the development of a tool for the learning of ontologies from \ac{LLM}~\cite{DBLP:conf/dlog/MagniniOS24}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MatteoMagnini/ExactLearner}}.
%
On the same topic, I have a paper submitted~\cite{DBLP:journals/kbs/CiattoKB24}.

In the rest of this report, I will provide a brief overview of the activities I have carried out during the second year of my PhD\@.
%
in particular, I have been working on several tasks, including research publications, teaching, visiting, participation in conferences, supervision of graduating students, and PhD courses.


\section{Period Abroad}\label{sec:period-abroad}
I have moved to Norway for a period of 3 months, from the 5th of March to the 8th of June 2024.
%
I was hosted by Prof.~Ana Ozaki at the University of Oslo, where I had the opportunity to work with her along with her research group.
%
During this period, I have been working on the development of a new tool for the learning of ontologies by means of \ac{LLM}.
%
In particular, the work started from the ExactLearner tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ExactLearner/ExactLearner}}, and it has been extended to support the learning of ontologies from text\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MatteoMagnini/ExactLearner}}.
%
One paper has been already published~\cite{DBLP:conf/dlog/MagniniOS24}, and a more comprehensive work is currently undergoing.
